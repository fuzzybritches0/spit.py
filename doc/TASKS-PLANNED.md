# TASKS-PLANNED.md

Tasks known to be wanted but not started. Light skeleton per task; the
referenced guides carry the detail. On starting a task: move its entry to
`TASKS-IN-PROGRESS.md`, create a branch first (never touch `main`, never
push), and keep the State field honest so an abandoned task is recoverable.

## P0 - DONE - garbled streaming render: tool-call arguments and streamed tool output

Branch `task-streaming-render-bugs` (`69bd1ba`, `ba87435`, `8cadc85`,
`c5a5443`), **merged into `main`**; resolution in `TASKS-FINISHED.md` (root
causes, the 278 checks of `tests/unit/render/`, the two accepted limits), the
fence-pairing rule in DECISIONS 59, and DECISIONS 71 for why it was closed by
the agent that held it rather than waiting on a human checklist that nobody had
asked for.

## P7 - MOVED to doc/UI-ROUTE-RATATUI.md — leave Textual for a ratatui front end  [high priority, architecture]

Decided 2026-09-07 (DECISIONS 65). The plan, the gates (M0–M5), the measurements
and the fallback ladder are in **`doc/UI-ROUTE-RATATUI.md`**; the front-end
contract is **`doc/UI-PROTOCOL.md`**.

- **Prerequisite**: **P0b**, the `terminal` tool returning an empty message
  container, filed on branch `task-terminal-empty-output`. Merge that branch
  first: P0b is also the harness the new front end is tested with
  (`UI-ROUTE-RATATUI.md`, "Prerequisite: the `terminal` tool").
- **Do not start before the owner approves M0** (a ~2-day gated spike).
- **Verify**: the M0 gate in the route doc; the full suite unchanged throughout
  (the tool layer imports no Textual, so its counts are the safety net).

## P1 - patch: the `is_header_pair` adjacency edge  [open, deliberate]

- **Scope**: `spit_app/tools/scripts/patch.py` (+ its test suite)
- **Status**: left open ON PURPOSE during the patch redesign. Not a forgotten bug.
- **Verify**: `cd ~/spit.py/spit_app/tests/tools/patch && bash run_tests.sh` (80 green);
  a fix adds tests without reusing freed numbers 5-9 (append-only).
- **Gotchas**: TRAPS #13/#15; DECISIONS 37 and the section below.
- **How to start**: read the verbatim record below first; the natural fix is to
  require a genuine file header to be followed by a `@@` hunk header or end of
  input. Prove the change by differential over every fixture (TESTING.md).

### 4. OPEN — the `is_header_pair` adjacency edge in `patch`

`is_header_pair()` decides a `--- old`/`+++ new` **pair** is a file header and skips
it. A *headerless* hunk that removes a line starting with `--` directly above an
added line starting with `++` produces exactly that shape as body content:

```
---x        (removing "--x")
+++y        (adding  "++y")
 keep
```

and the two lines are skipped as if they were a file header. Consequence is a loud
no-match failure, not corruption, and the shape is rare. Left unfixed on purpose so
it is a decision rather than an oversight; if it is ever fixed, the natural fix is to
require that a genuine file header be followed by a `@@` hunk header or end the
input, not merely be a pair.

## P2 - DONE - `rename` implemented  [medium priority]

Branch `rename-tool`, commit `7c1d062` (docs in the follow-up commit);
resolution in `TASKS-FINISHED.md`, spec in TOOLS.md #14, policy
rationale DECISIONS 60. The drafted spec below (verbatim) stays here.

## P3 - New tool: `copy`  [medium priority, not started]
## P4 - New tool: `code_parser`  [low priority, not started]

- **Scope**: new files `spit_app/tools/<name>.py` +
  `spit_app/tools/scripts/<name>.py` + `spit_app/tests/tools/<name>/`
  (exactly three files: `setup.json`, `run_tests.sh`, `create_fixtures.sh`).
- **Verify**: full suite `bash ~/spit.py/spit_app/tests/run_tests.sh` stays green;
  new suite's checks counted in its summary line.
- **Gotchas**: TRAPS #21 (PATH_ARGS), #2 (`git commit -F` is house style,
  author with write_file; the pollution trap it warned about is resolved),
  #10 (generated fixtures only); follow CONVENTIONS.md module
  contract end to end; both destructive file tools need `dry_run`.
- **Drafted specs (verbatim)**:

## Tools Planned (Not Yet Implemented)

### 1. `rename` (Medium Priority)
**Purpose**: Rename/move files

**Parameters**:
- `old_path` (required): Current file path
- `new_path` (required): New file path
- `dry_run` (optional): Preview without renaming. Default: `False`

**Output**: Success/error message

---

### 2. `copy` (Medium Priority)
**Purpose**: Copy files with options

**Parameters**:
- `source` (required): Source file path
- `destination` (required): Destination path
- `preserve_permissions` (optional): Keep permissions. Default: `False`
- `dry_run` (optional): Preview without copying. Default: `False`

**Output**: Success/error, bytes copied

---

### 3. `code_parser` (Low Priority)
**Purpose**: Parse code structure

**Parameters**:
- `path` (required): File path
- `language` (optional): Language (python, javascript, etc.)

**Output**: Functions, classes, imports, dependencies

## P5 - DONE - run_script: the `interpreters` setting restricts the prompt, not the call  [medium priority, security-adjacent]

Branch `fix-run-script-interpreter-allow-list`: `5494c9a` (the enforcement and
38 checks, suite 83 -> 121) and `52ca61c` (DECISIONS 64, TOOLS.md,
RUNTIME-RUN-COMMAND.md, TESTING.md). The call was made in favour of
enforcement -- the field is a permission, so the tool obeys it, and the refusal
quotes the list back. The question as written stays below (verbatim, with the
`enforces nothing` of the first bullet now historical), because the reasoning
that made it a decision is the thing worth keeping.

Found while fixing the wrapper (DECISIONS 63, branch
`fix-prompt-join-and-run-script`) and deliberately left out of that commit --
one concern each, and this one is a policy call, not a bug fix.

- **The gap** (as found; closed by `5494c9a`): `SETTINGS["interpreters"]` (default `bash, python3, perl`) is
  used for exactly one thing -- substituting the `[interpreters]` token in
  PROMPT_INST. The call itself checks only `shutil.which(interpreter)`, so any
  interpreter on `PATH` runs: the setting tells the model what it is *offered*
  and enforces nothing.
- **The call to make**: is the sandbox the boundary and the list a hint (then
  the setting's description should say so, since a user tightening it believes
  they have restricted the tool), or is membership enforced? If enforced: a set
  comparison against the user's own setting, an error naming it and listing
  what is allowed, and checks in `tests/unit/run_script/` -- which already
  stubs `shutil.which`, so the shapes are there.
- **Verify**: `cd ~/spit.py && bash spit_app/tests/run_tests.sh` (unit:run_script
  83 must not move unless checks are added; ground truth TESTING.md).

## P6 - Longer-term roadmap (from the repo README, no specs yet)

- More advanced agent capabilities
- GUI/TUI alternative to Textual
- Audio

These are owner-level roadmap items, not pick-up-and-code tasks; do not start
them without explicit instruction.
