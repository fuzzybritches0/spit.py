# TASKS-IN-PROGRESS.md

This file is the agents' own crash-recovery record. An entry exists so that, if
a session dies, the next agent picks the work up from the **State** fields
instead of re-deriving it — nothing here is for the owner's review, and the
whole `doc/` set exists to support the agent's work. Nothing in this file is
finished. Whoever holds an entry closes it, alone, when its **Verify** is met:
run the FULL suite from the repo root, confirm the ground-truth counts moved
only by the checks the task added, write the resolution into
`TASKS-FINISHED.md`, delete the entry here. No owner sign-off enters into that
(DECISIONS 71, TRAPS #22) — the owner's gate is the `Go!` asked **before**
changing code, and the merge of the branch, which is the only part of finishing
that is not the agent's.

## Machine state these entries assume (none of it is in git)

- **The test venv**: `bash spit_app/tests/create_venv.sh` → `~/.venv-spit`
  (all of `requirements.txt`). `unit:terminal` needs libtmux and reports
  `PASS: 0  FAIL: 1` with the remedy when it cannot import it — never a silent
  zero. `doc/TESTING.md`, "The test venv". Note the `unset PIP_USER
  PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` inside that script: this environment exports both
  and a virtualenv refuses a `--user` install outright.
- **Never drive a shared tmux.** `tests/unit/terminal/stub_app.py` wraps
  `libtmux.Server` to pass `socket_name`, so the suite runs on its own server and
  may `kill-server` freely. A run leaves stale socket *files* under
  `/tmp/tmux-1000/spit-unit-terminal-*` and **no running server**; removing the
  files is safe, and any new terminal test must keep both properties.

## P0b-followup 4 - what the `terminal` tool still needs *for* the ratatui migration  [enhancement list, picked up piece by piece]

The list below was written during P0b and is **verbatim from it**; four items
have moved since — 8, 9, 10 and 12 — and each is marked **where it is marked
done, never where it is still open**. Nothing else has been done, re-checked
against the source 2026-09-10: `spit_app/tools/terminal.py` still accepts
exactly `name`, `input` and `delay`, so items 1-7 and 11 have no code behind
them at all.

**Already done while fixing P0b** (so do not re-do them): the *single
implementation* half of item 9 — `pane_active()` now exists once in
`run/terminal.py` and `lsterm` uses it (`c948b3e`); the *namespaced windows* half
of item 9 has its foundation now (followup 1.5: tmux itself names the windows,
the registry resolves by its own names, and an unresolved name answers "no such
session") — whether the tool should fail *loudly* beyond that answer is still an
open choice. Item 8 (process state as first-class output) is mostly done: a dead
pane reports its REAL final screen and its exit code (followup 1), every field
the snapshot needs already includes `pane_pid`/`pane_current_command`/geometry,
and the state layer those come from — DECISIONS 69's recommendation and the
one `list-panes -a` per call — **landed as followup 1.5**; `pane_dead_signal`
and `pane_dead_time` (tmux >= 3.3) are two more tokens away in that format
line. What is left of item 8 is surfacing them as fields on a LIVE
screen — a formatting job now, not a plumbing one.

Once `spit-tui` exists (the Rust front end planned in
`doc/UI-ROUTE-RATATUI.md` and the engine <-> front-end protocol in
`doc/UI-PROTOCOL.md` — both merged into this branch at `51faf79`, so they are
**here**, read them here), this tool stops being a convenience and becomes **the only harness that can see the
real binary running in a real pty** — ratatui's `TestBackend` covers widgets,
the `terminal` tool covers the end-to-end app. Design it for that job now:

1. **`command`, not hardcoded `bash`.** Launch arbitrary argv in the pane
   (`command=["./spit-tui"]`, plus `env={}`, `cwd=`) — "start the UI under test"
   is the primitive; interactive bash is a special case of it.
2. **Geometry you control.** `cols`/`rows` at creation and a `resize` action.
   Re-wrap-on-resize is load-bearing in the new architecture (measured: 746 ms
   to re-wrap 2,000 messages), and it cannot be tested at 24x80 only. During
   this evaluation I had to nest a private tmux server to get 120x40 and
   150x35.
3. **Capture modes: text | styled | bytes.** Today only plain text. `styled`
   (`capture-pane -e`) is how markdown/heading/highlight/border styling gets
   asserted. `bytes` (raw pane output) is how the **Kitty/Sixel graphics path
   gets asserted** — LaTeX and image rendering could not be verified at all in
   this environment because there is no way to see the escape sequences, and
   that is the single biggest unproven risk in the migration.
4. **Cursor as data, not decoration.** Report `cursor_x`/`cursor_y` as fields
   instead of splicing a `█` into the text (which corrupts the line and breaks
   under double-width characters); keep the marker as an option.
5. **`wait_for` instead of `delay`.** Wait until a regex matches the pane or the
   screen is stable for N ms, with a timeout — blind sleeps make streaming tests
   flaky, and streaming (token deltas, follow-bottom, abort) is the main thing
   the new UI must get right.
6. **`send_bytes` / raw mode**, so a test can inject SGR mouse sequences and
   bracketed paste. That is exactly how pyratatui's mouse and paste defects were
   proven (4 injected sequences → 0 delivered; a pasted Enter arriving as
   `Ctrl+J` wipes the line), and the new front end's input layer must be tested
   against the same sequences.
7. **Scrollback and diffs**: `capture(since=-N)` and "changed lines since last
   capture". With no scrollback and full-screen captures, an agent burns context
   re-reading the same 24 lines; a diff capture makes long-session work cheap.
8. **Process state as first-class output**: `pane_pid`,
   `pane_current_command`, exited-with-code. Today a dead pane is one sentence
   with no content, so a crashed UI and an empty UI look identical.
9. **Namespaced sessions.** One tmux session per chat is right, but windows are
   addressed by bare `name`, and a call naming a session that does not exist can
   land on an already-running window instead of failing (this bit me live: the
   first call of a session named `prt` reached a different, already-attached
   pane). Prefix windows by `chat_id`, name the tmux window, and fail loudly on
   a name that does not resolve — `lsterm` should list the same names, and its
   private `pane_active()` (which mutates state as a side effect of *listing*)
   should be the one implementation in `Terminal`.
10. **Non-blocking and cancellable**: the wait must not block the UI loop; an
    in-flight `terminal` call should be abortable (the engine already has
    `kill_process_group` and the abort path — TRAPS #4). **Half settled**:
    DECISIONS 68 measured the shipped path and the loop is not blocked (a sync
    `call()` goes through `asyncio.to_thread`), so do not "fix" that half
    again; what is left is the abortable in-flight call, which lands with
    item 5 (`wait_for` replaces the blind `delay`).
11. **Structured output option** (`format="json"`: rows, cursor, attrs, bytes,
    process state) so tests assert on data instead of parsing prose.
12. **Sandbox stays on by default** (and lifecycle tests use `sandbox=False`,
    TRAPS #6), and teardown is guaranteed: a `kill` that takes the process group
    and auto-cleanup when the chat closes. During this evaluation the only way
    to clean up orphaned sessions was `tmux kill-server`, which is not
    acceptable in a shared tmux. **Partly landed since**: the sessions now run
    on a tmux socket of spit.py's own, `spit-<pid>`, so `kill-server` can never
    reach the user's server (`3f6b279`, DECISIONS 69 a), a reported corpse is
    destroyed at the moment it is reported (`retire()`, `e5b4fba`), and the app
    kills its own server at exit. What is left is teardown when a single **chat**
    closes — `actions.py:action_exit_app` is still the only thing that frees
    anything, so a closed chat's windows outlive the chat.

### State (crash-recovery record)

- **Branch**: none started. Everything marked landed above is on `main` via
  `task-terminal-empty-output`; this entry has no working branch of its own.
- **Scope** (when it starts): `spit_app/tools/terminal.py` (DESC + PROMPT),
  `spit_app/tools/run/terminal.py` (the state layer every item reads from),
  `spit_app/tools/lsterm.py`, and `tests/unit/terminal/` (220 checks, real tmux
  on a private socket through `stub_app.py`).
- **Done**: items 8, 9, 10 and 12, as marked where each is marked — nothing else.
- **Left**: pick ONE item, give it its own branch and its own `Go!`. The natural
  first pair is items 5 + 10 (`wait_for` replaces the blind `delay`, which is
  also what makes an in-flight call abortable — DECISIONS 68 says the loop is
  already free, so this is about cancellation and flaky sleeps, not about
  freezing the UI); the natural single starter is item 1 (`command=` + `env=` +
  `cwd=`), which is self-contained and unblocks any harness work on `spit-tui`.
- **State hazards**: none. `tests/unit/terminal/` leaves stale socket *files*
  under `/tmp/tmux-1000/spit-unit-terminal-*` with no server behind them —
  safe to remove, and any new test must keep that property.
- **Verify**: full suite from the repo root. `unit:terminal` goes up by the new
  checks and nothing else moves. The rendered screen is the contract: prove any
  capture-formatting change **byte-for-byte** against the current output before
  changing behaviour (TRAPS #14), and keep the sandbox on by default (TRAPS #6)
  with `sandbox=False` only inside lifecycle tests.

## Protocol when starting a task from TASKS-PLANNED.md

1. `git branch -a` (avoid name collisions), create a descriptively named
   branch. Never work on `main`, never push. Ask for the owner's `Go!` before
   the first **code** change; an entry that is waiting on that `Go!` still
   lives here, with **Left** saying exactly that.
2. Move the entry here and keep these fields current AS YOU WORK - they are
   the crash-recovery record:
   - **Branch**: name + last commit sha on it
   - **Scope**: files touched so far
   - **Done**: what is complete and verified
   - **Left**: the precise next step, small enough to finish in one sitting
   - **State hazards**: half-finished edits, fixtures left over
     (`KEEP_FIXTURES`), uncommitted changes, suites currently red
   - **Verify**: command + expected result that closes the task
3. Commit early and often on the branch (one concern per commit) so the
   recovery point is a commit, not an uncommitted working tree.
4. On completion: run the FULL suite from the repo root, confirm ground-truth
   counts only went up by your new checks, move the entry to
   TASKS-FINISHED.md with the resolution (branch, commits, outcome), delete
   this entry. **That decision is yours to make — there is no sign-off step.**
   Do not leave a finished entry here because a human "should look at it": put
   the by-hand check inside the finished entry if it is still worth doing, and
   say in the resolution which verification the close-out rested on. If an
   item cannot be performed in this environment at all, it was never a
   verification, and saying so out loud is better than an entry that can never
   close (TRAPS #22).
5. An abandoned entry keeps its State fields honest — that is the entire point
   of the file: **Left** is one sitting's next step, **State hazards** names
   what is red, half-edited or left in `/tmp`, and the recovery point is a
   commit, never an uncommitted tree.
